\begin{problem}{15}{6}
  How does \textit{this} trick work?
  
  \textnormal{\textit{`Here's an ordinary pack of cards shuffled into random order.  Please choose five cards from the pack, any you wish. Don't let me see their faces. No, don't give them to me: pass them to my assistant Esmerelda.  She can look at them.}}
  
  \textnormal{\textit{`Now, Esmerelda, show me four of the cards.  Hmm...nine of spades, six of clubs, four of hearts, ten of diamonds. The hidden card must be the queen of spades.}}
  
  This trick can be performed as described above for a pack of 52 cards.  Use information theory to give an upper bound on the number of cards for which the trick can be performed.
\end{problem}

A set of unique objects (e.g.,~cards in a deck) can be bijectively mapped to the set of integers $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ where $n$ is the cardinality of the set. If we try to use the same trick as in the previous problem, then we will run into an issue since there would only be four letters (one for each of the revealed cards) and ${}_{4}P_{4} = 4! = 24$ permutations.  If $n=52$, this is not enough permutations to cover the whole deck so we need to get more creative....
