\begin{problem}{4}{14}
  You are given 12 balls and the three-outcome balance of exercise 4.1; this time, two of the balls are odd; each odd ball may be heavy or light, and we don't know which.  We want to identify the odd balls and in which direction they are odd.
\end{problem}

\begin{subproblem}
  \textit{Estimate} how many weights are required by the optimal strategy.  And what if there are three odd balls.
\end{subproblem}

\begin{subproblem}
  How do your answers change if it is known that all the regular balls weigh 100g, that light balls weight 99g, and heavy ones weigh 110g.
\end{subproblem}
