\begin{problem}{2}{9}{33}
  Two points are selected at random on a straight line segment of length~1.  What is the probability that a triangle can be constructed out of the three resulting segments?
\end{problem}

For the two randomly selected points,~$x_1$ and $x_2$, define $L_{\max}$ as the length of the longest segment.  By the triangle inequality theorem, it is clear that a triangle can only be formed from these three resulting segments if ${L_{\max} < 0.5}$.


Consider the tuple ${(x_1,x_2)}$. Each point in the domain $(0,1)^2$ is equally likely since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are selected randomly.  Figure~\ref{fig:problem2.9.33} shows the portions of this domain (highlighted in light blue) where the lines segments induced by $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be used to form a triangle.

Since the probability of selecting any point from the above domain is uniform, the probability of selecting points that form a triangle is found via:

\begin{aligncustom}
  \Pr(\text{Form a triangle}) &= \frac{\text{Shaded Area}}{\text{Total Area}}\\
                              &= \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{3}}{1}\\
                              &= \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}
\end{aligncustom}
